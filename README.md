## Download Project From Github

Link to the project [here](https://github.com/QuocTrung810/monkey_collection_marketplace)

## Getting Started

To run the project, we need to download external packages into the project according to the command below:

```bash
npm install yarn @chakra-ui/react @emotion/react @emotion/styled framer-motion
```

The npm install command line you provided is to install some npm packages for your project. Let's look at each package one by one:

* `yarn`: Is a JavaScript package manager, often used to manage npm packages more efficiently. It provides the ability to load packages from local clones, create immutable clones, and has many other features compared to npm.
* `@chakra-ui/react`: Is a React library that provides reusable UI components and a built-in design system to help you build user interfaces quickly.
* `@emotion/react and @emotion/styled`: Are libraries that support CSS management in React applications. @emotion/react provides the core API for emotion, while @emotion/styled is a styled-components version of emotion.
* `framer-motion`: Is a library that helps you add motion and animation effects to your React application easily.

If you still do not have a metamask account, you can follow metamask's instructions to create a wallet.

After you have created a wallet, you can go to [this website](https://mumbaifaucet.com/?fbclid=IwAR2vwur9namv1X5rmmoGuE5WMI_6pXS9DgxOsFqhASpahT1MzzFGbRDvk-8) and provide the wallet adrress id to receive 0.2 matic.

This is the interface after connecting to the wallet:
